# Mids-Capstone-Summarization

## Summarization of articles for social media marketing

### Problem
Companies generate whitepapers, blogs, competitive reports and other infomercial content to showcase the benefits of using their products. A good short text summarization goes a long way in capturing the attention of potential customers who won't through the document in its entirety unless they seem relevant and interesting. In the current world, potential customers are segmented across different kinds of social networks like Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin. A company would like to target customers in these different networks by running various advertising campaigns with advertisements containing different summaries of the same underlying content to get the user's attention many times in order to be effective. We will be using abstractive text summarization techniques using language models trained on domain specific open data.
